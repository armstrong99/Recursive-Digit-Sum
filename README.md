We define super digit of an integer  using the following rules:

Given an integer, we need to find the super digit of the integer.

If  has only  digit, then its super digit is .
Otherwise, the super digit of  is equal to the super digit of the sum of the digits of .
For example, the super digit of  will be calculated as:

	super_digit(9875)   	9+8+7+5 = 29 
	super_digit(29) 	2 + 9 = 11
	super_digit(11)		1 + 1 = 2
	super_digit(2)		= 2  
You are given two numbers  and . The number  is created by concatenating the string   times. Continuing the above example where , assume your value . Your initial  (spaces added for clarity).

    superDigit(p) = superDigit(9875987598759875)
                  5+7+8+9+5+7+8+9+5+7+8+9+5+7+8+9 = 116
    superDigit(p) = superDigit(116)
                  1+1+6 = 8
    superDigit(p) = superDigit(8)
All of the digits of  sum to . The digits of  sum to .  is only one digit, so it's the super digit.
